6. Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times indicated. Each process will run for the amount of time listed. In answering the questions, use nonpreemptive scheduling, and base all decisions on the information you have at the time the decision must be made. Process Arrival Time Burst Time P1  0.0   8 P2  0.4   4 P3  1.0   1 a. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the FCFS scheduling algorithm?
